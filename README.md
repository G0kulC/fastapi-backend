# FastAPI Backend Architecture

Welcome to the **FastAPI Backend Architecture** repository! This project showcases a structured and scalable backend architecture built using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.10.

The repository follows best practices for organizing a backend project, incorporating key components such as routers, models, schemas, and services to maintain scalability, maintainability, and ease of testing.

## 📑 Documentation

All the project details, including architectural decisions, folder structures, setup instructions, and usage guidelines, are comprehensively documented in the [**Project Documentation (PDF)**](./docs/project_documentation.pdf). Please refer to this file for in-depth information.

### Key Highlights of the Architecture:
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured in a way that separates concerns across routers, models, schemas, and core functionalities, ensuring modularity and flexibility.
- **Database Integration**: The architecture supports easy integration with databases using SQLAlchemy or similar ORMs.
- **Cython Optimizations**: Certain parts of the codebase are optimized using Cython for performance improvement (optional).
- **Dependency Injection**: Designed to support FastAPI’s dependency injection for services, ensuring clean, testable, and extendable code.
- **Async Capabilities**: Fully async-enabled, allowing for high concurrency and performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10+
- Docker (optional for containerization)
- PostgreSQL or another relational database (if applicable)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-backend-architecture.git
    cd fastapi-backend-architecture
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the FastAPI application:
    ```bash
    uvicorn api.main:app --reload
    ```

4. Access the application:
    - API Documentation: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
    - OpenAPI Schema: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json](http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json)

### Using Docker

To run the project using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t fastapi-backend .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 fastapi-backend
    ```

3. The app will be available at: `http://localhost:8080`
